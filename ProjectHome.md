Omoma is a financial web application.

Its goal is to offer everyone a way to manage their financial data easily, with any web browser, on any computer, from anywhere. Is is only a software at the moment, not an online service.

It is usable, but far from optimal... future developments will greatly improve that.

# Features #

Omoma has (or will have) many features inspired from different finance tools... Important ones are :

  * multiple accounts
  * categories
  * division of transactions between multiple categories
  * IOUs (tell that someone owes money from you or that you owe money)
  * transactions validation (reconciliation)
  * budgets, envelopes
  * projections
  * file imports

For a complete features list, see FeaturesList

# Ongoing development #

Yeah, right, this is a fairly new project. You can't be sure it will be the perfect tool, or it will stay there forever. I, as the project creator, don't want to make bad things. That's why :

  * I'm using it, therefore improving it to fit (at least) my needs
  * I plan to make it possible to easily export data from Omoma; in the meantime, you can access all the data in your database.
  * I'm releasing this projet under the Open Source GNU GPL v3 licence.

# Help needed #

We need help from many people to improve this software:

  * Testers: to make Omoma bug reports
  * Writers: to make Omoma documentation
  * Translators: to make Omoma multi-lingual
  * Artists: to make Omoma logo and icons
  * Web designers: to make Omoma beautiful
  * Python/Django developers: to make Omoma better
