Installing Omoma
################

This document explains how to install Omoma.

For a complete and simple how-to install Omoma on Ubuntu,
please see the INSTALL_UBUNTU file.

This document only contains technical information.

Prerequisite
============

 * Somewhere to host the web service
 * Python (version 2.6)
 * Django (version 1.2)
 * A SQL database (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, Oracle)
 * optionally, a web server

Hosting service
===============

You can host the service on your own computer, of course.

You can also host it on the Internet, see the following URI:
http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoFriendlyWebHosts

Python and Django
=================

To install Python and Django, please refer to the following URI:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/install/

You can get more details on installing/deploying Django at the following URI:
http://djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter12/

Database
========

You need a database to store Django data. Either PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL,
or Oracle. You have to create a database and give Django access to it (with
rights to create tables).

Configuring Omoma
=================

The configuration takes place in settings.py

You need to configure :

 * DEBUG: True of False, it's up to you
 * DATABASES: set what applies to your database in "default"
 * TIME_ZONE: your timezone
 * LANGUAGE_CODE: your language identifier
 * SECRET_KEY: any random string
 * TEMPLATE_DIRS: that depends on the place where you've installed Omoma
   It should reference the "templates" subdir in the Omoma directory
 * LOGIN_URL and LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL: you may add a prefix if you serve Omoma
   in a subdirectory

Preparing Omoma
===============

You can put the Omoma code anywhere you want.
``/opt/omoma`` may be a good choice.

Then, from the Omoma directory, execute the following command::

    python manage.py syncdb

Running Omoma
=============

You can either use a web server or run the development server.

To install with a web server, see the following URI:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/howto/deployment/

To run the development server, execute the following command::

    python manage.py runserver

If you want Omoma to be reachable from other computers on your network, you
may run the following command::

    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

... but for real "production" use, a real web server is prefered.
