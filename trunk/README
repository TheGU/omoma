Omoma is a financial application.

Its name means "Online Money Management".

History
=======

I started creating Omoma in late 2010, when Buxfer was really slow... Then I've
been more than motivated when Buxfer went down for at least 1 week.

I'm developing Omoma as a hobby, on evenings or weekends...
