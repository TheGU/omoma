How to install Omoma on Ubuntu
##############################

This chapter is for people that don't know much about systems, databases, etc
and that just want to try Omoma on their Ubunbtu system.

There is no automatic installation for the moment, Omoma being in an early
development stage.

The database will be SQLite, the lighter databases that doesn't need a running
daemon. The web server will be the development server, allowing to serve all
files without running an independent web server.

However, please note that running Omoma on your own computer and using it alone
currently makes the IOU stuff useless.

Prerequisite
============

This how-to is intended for *Ubuntu 10.10*.
It has not been tested on other versions.

I assume you have already downloaded Omoma. You should have an ``omoma``
directory, containing ``locale``, ``media``, ``omoma_web`` and ``template``
subdirectories, with ``.py``, ``.html``, ``.png``, ``.css`` files.

You need to access the Internet for some informations if you don't know them
(timezone name, language code).

This how-to is based in command-line and text editing.
You will need the *Terminal* (located in the *Accessories* menu). Anywhere you
read "run the following command", this means you have to type the command in
the terminal. Some commands (starting with ``sudo``) may ask for your password.

To edit files, you can use *gedit* (also in the *Accessories* menu). You may
also simply double-click on the files you want to edit in your file browser.

No root needed
--------------

You may know about the *root* user, the local administrator. You don't need
root access to run Django. You only need it to install packages (with the
``sudo apt-get install`` command).

Installing Omoma
================

First, copy or move the ``omoma`` directory anywhere you want

Directly in your home directory works perfectly. If you put the ``omoma``
directory in your home directory, then its *path* is
``/home/<your_username>/omoma`` (replace ``<your_username>`` by your username).

If you put the ``omoma`` directory on your desktop, then its *path* is
``/home/<your_username>/Desktop/omoma`` (for an english system).

If you want to put the ``omoma`` directory somewhere else, you can easily guess
the *path*. You will need to know your ``omoma`` path later. In the following
examples, the ``omoma`` directory is assumed to be in your home directory.

First, you need to install *Django* (the framework used by Omoma) and SQLite.
Run the following command::

    sudo apt-get install python-django python-pysqlite2

Configuring Omoma
=================

Next, you should configure Django.

Copy the ``local_settings.py.default`` file as ``local_settings.py``. It can be
easily done by running the following commands::

    cd /home/<your_username>/omoma
    cp local_settings.py.default local_settings.py

Edit the ``local_settings.py`` file (simply by clicking on it). This file
contains many directives that tell Omoma how to work, you have to modify them
to fit your system.

You should only modify the ones explained here. Modifying other directived can
make Omoma crash.

The line starting with ``DEBUG`` should be::

    DEBUG = False

There is a section called ``DATABASES``, containing a ``'default'`` subsection.
In this subsection, you have to set the ``ENGINE`` and ``NAME`` variables::

    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
    'NAME': 'my_omomoa_database.sqlite3',

The ``TIME_ZONE`` directive should refer to your timezone. See the table at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones_by_name (column "TZ") for your
timezone name. For example, at the South Pole, the timezone should be set as::

    TIME_ZONE = 'Antarctica/South_Pole'

The ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` directive should be set to your local language. See the
table at http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/language-identifiers.html (column
"Languages") to know your language code. For example, in Gibraltar, the language
code would be::

    LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-GI'

However, please note that Omoma is not translated in many languages (english
and french when writing this how-to). If your language is not supported by
Omoma, it will fall back to english.

The ``SECRET_KEY`` should be any textual string. Just type anything.
Really anything: letters, numbers, parenthesis, hiphens, etc. You just need to
avoid the ' character (because it is the string delimiter). For example::

    SECRET_KEY = 'rzegfz7RT564-"rt35Y675)}=+rREHgezrT3Efr7eZE'

The ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` sections is a list of paths containing only one path, to
set to the ``templates`` subdirectory in your ``omoma`` directory path::

    TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
        '/home/<your_username>/omoma/templates',
    )

The ``STATIC_ROOT`` is where static files (icons, for instance) are stored. Set
it to the path to the ``media`` subdirectory in your ``omoma`` directory path::

    STATIC_ROOT = '/home/<your_username>/omoma/media'

Save and close this file.

Now, you have to generate the data needed for Omoma : the tables that will be
used to store your data in the database. To generate the tables, run the
following commands::

    cd /home/<your_username>/omoma
    python manage.py syncdb

This command should see that your are just initializing the database, and you
don't have any superusers defined. It asks if you would like to create one,
you should answer yes::

    Would you like to create one now? (yes/no): yes

It then asks the username, you may just press "Enter" if you want to use your
current username::

    Username (Leave blank to use '<your_username>'): 

It asks for your e-mail address, it can be used to send you e-mails when Omoma
has problems. This is only useful when you run Omoma as a web service, which you
won't; you can enter anything, the address doesn't need to exist::

    E-mail address: anything@example.com

It then asks for a password. This is the password to set for the user to be
created. Enter any password you want (twice). As a security measure, when
typing, the password will not be displayed.

::

    Password: 
    Password (again): 


It should then say::

    Superuser created successfully.
    Installing index for auth.Permission model
    Installing index for auth.Group_permissions model
    Installing index for auth.User_user_permissions model
    Installing index for auth.User_groups model
    Installing index for auth.Message model
    Installing index for admin.LogEntry model
    Installing index for omoma_web.Account_owner model
    Installing index for omoma_web.Account model
    Installing index for omoma_web.Transaction model
    Installing index for omoma_web.Category model
    Installing index for omoma_web.TransactionCategory model
    Installing index for omoma_web.IOU model
    Installing index for omoma_web.Budget model
    No fixtures found.

And voil√†! Omoma is installed.

Running Omoma
=============

Once the database is initialized, you can run Omoma. To do so, run the following
commands::

    cd /home/<your_username>/omoma
    python manage.py runserver

This allows you to access Omoma, but nobody else on your network. If you want
to share your Omoma database with someone else (to allow IOUs for example), you
can run the following commands instead::

    cd /home/<your_username>/omoma
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Other people can access Omoma only when it is running on your computer.

Accessing Omoma
===============

To access Omoma, you should go to the following address with your web browser:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000

You can now enter the username and password that were just created.

    ``127.0.0.1`` is your own computer address - the current computer is always
    ``127.0.0.1``, no matter where you are. ``8000`` is a TCP port: to allow
    multiple connections, the TCP/IP protocol (used on the Internet and the vast
    majority of computer networks nowadays) defines "ports", a single connection
    uses a single port; every computer has 65535 ports.

When you come from other computers, you should go to the computer's address, on
port 8000 too:

    http://<your_computer_address>:8000

To get your computer address, use the network manager applet on your GNOME
desktop: the little icon showing the network state; when right-clicking on this
applet and choosing "Connection information", you get a window displaying your
connection(s) and detailing its address, in the "IP Address" field. This address
can, for example, be 192.168.1.10; in this case, the address to access Omoma on
another computer would be:

    http://192.168.1.10:8000

    Note that accessing from other computers can work only in your local network
    (unless you are directly connected to the Internet, which is risky).

Creating currencies
-------------------

For the moment, there is no Omoma-specific interface to create currencies, and
there is no preset currency. To create a currency, go to the following URI:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/omoma_web/currency

You can add a currency with the "Add currency" link in the top right corner of
the page. For the moment, Omoma only works with a single currency, so simply
set its rate to 1.

Stopping Omoma
==============

To stop Omoma, you just need the ``Ctrl-C`` keystroke in the terminal running
Omoma.

"Ctrl-C" means that you have to press one of the "Ctrl" key, keep it pressed,
press the "C" key and then release both keys. This shortcut can alse be written
``^C``.

To close the terminal, you can close its window or run the following command::

    exit

I've accessed Omoma... what next ?
==================================

You first need to create an account (or multiple accounts) in the
"Configuration"/"Accounts" screen (link in the menu on the left).

Add other users
===============

If you want to create IOUs, you have to add other users. To do so, access the
following address::

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/user/

This is a Django administration page. You can add users with the "Add user" link
in the top right corner of the page.

IOUs ?
======

An IOU makes it possible to mark that someone owes you money, or that you owe
money to someone. To be able to create IOUs in Omoma, both people should use the
same installation of Omoma (communication beween multiple Omoma instances may be
added later).

This limitation is linked to the fact that the other person has to accept your
IOUs for them to be taken into account.

The database
============

All your data is stored in the database configured in the ``DATABASES`` section
of the ``local_settings.py`` configuration file. If you have specified
``my_omoma_database.sqlite3``, then the ``my_omoma_database.sqlite3`` file
contains all your data. You may backup this file to keep your money data safe.

.pyc files
==========

Files ending with .pyc will be created in the ``omoma`` directory and the
``omoma_web`` subdirectory. They are harmless. Deleting them is harmless. The
Python interpreter simply creates them if they don't exist, to make Omoma run
faster.
